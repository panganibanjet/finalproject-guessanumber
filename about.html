      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Welcome to Guess a Number from 1 to 100! Are you ready to put your guessing skills to the test? <br> This classic game is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat as you try to crack the secret number.
        <br>
        Here's how it works: we have a mystery number between 1 and 100, and it's your job to figure out what it is. <br> You'll make guesses, and we'll provide hints to guide you along the way. <br> Pay close attention to the hints, as they will help you narrow down your options and get closer to the target.
        <br>
        Remember, the secret number could be any whole number between 1 and 100, so keep your thinking cap on! <br> Start by making your first guess, and we'll let you know if you're too high or too low. <br> Use the process of elimination and logical reasoning to make subsequent guesses until you hit the bullseye.
        <br> Good luck, and happy guessing!
